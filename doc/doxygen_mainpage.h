\section description Parallel Object Execution Threads
libpoet is a framework intended to make creation of active objects easy
enough for routine use.  Some of the more important classes in the library
are poet::future, poet::active_function, and poet::scheduler.  To learn
more about active objects, see the paper
<a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~doc/pspdfs/Act-Obj.pdf">"Active Object, An Object Behavioral Pattern for Concurrent Programming." by
R. Greg Lavender and Douglas C. Schmidt</a>.
