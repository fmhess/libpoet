Parallel Object Execution Threads

libpoet is a framework intended to make creation of active objects easy 
enough for routine use. Some of the more important classes in the library 
are poet::future, poet::active_function, and poet::scheduler. 

The release tarballs should have html documentation in the doc/boostbook/html 
subdirectory.
