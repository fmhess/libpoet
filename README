Parallel Object Execution Threads

libpoet is a C++ library intended to make creation of active objects easy 
enough for routine use. Some of the more important classes in the library 
are poet::future, poet::active_function, and poet::scheduler. 

libpoet also provides support for creating monitor objects via the 
poet::monitor_ptr and poet::monitor_base classes. 

The release tarballs should have html documentation in the doc/boostbook/html 
subdirectory.
