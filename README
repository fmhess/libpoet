Parallel Object Execution Threads

libpoet is a framework intended to make creation of active objects easy 
enough for routine use. Some of the more important classes in the library 
are poet::future, poet::active_function, and poet::scheduler. 

There should be html documentation in the doc/html subdirectory.  If
not, it can be generated by running "doxygen" in the doc subdirectory.

The libpoet home page is at:
